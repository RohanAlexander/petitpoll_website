In a few hours Malcolm Turnbull is expected to announce an election. This will be Petit Poll's first outing and our initial surveys are ready to go.

The plan at the moment is an initial distribution of the surveys to friends/family to help work out any issues with the questions and the reporting process. We should have our first results at that time and they'll be posted here.

After those first few days of the campaign we'll have a wider roll-out.
