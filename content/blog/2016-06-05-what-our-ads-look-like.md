Unless you live in Canberra you are unlikely to be exposed to our Facebook/Twitter ads. So I thought I'd take a moment to show you what they look like.

Our current Facebook/Twitter ads look like this:

They (hopefully) draw a viewer in with the photo, and then ask a question about the photo. For those who don't know, these are images of Canberra, and many Canberrans would recognize them. At this point, we link their answer to a possible interest in taking our polls.

The ads are targeted at Facebook/Twitter users in Canberra. Of course, in an ideal world we would get a wide-variety of respondents. However, we have a limited budget, and in any case my understanding of advertising campaigns is that specific is better than general. Although we would likely only get a certain type of respondent, Petit Poll's underlying model should mean that is not as disqualifying as it would be to normal polling.

For those of you who are interested, here is my first attempt at a Facebook ad.

The ad ran across all of Australia, rather than being targeted at a particular city and there is no link between the photo and the text. So I think our second-generation ads are an improvement, but there is probably much more than can be done.

If you have any advice around Facebook/Twitter ads, then please do get in touch.
