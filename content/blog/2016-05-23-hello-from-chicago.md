Sorry for the silence for the past few days. I was busy with a presentation at the end of last week, and over the weekend Monica and I moved to Chicago for summer which meant moving out of our Berkeley apartment.

Expect an update on the latest polling tomorrow, and continued improvements to Petit Poll over this week as we get back into it.
