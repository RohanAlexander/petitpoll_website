We just ran the model on the tiny sample that we were able to gather from friends and family. There are a huge number of issues that we still need to solve, but the process seems to work.

We have the election at 50:50 (this number is meaningless for any purpose other than suggesting that our process seems to work and the model outputs a number that isn't outrageous).

Nonetheless, to celebrate this thimble's worth of success I will be at the bar with at least a teapot's worth of beer.
