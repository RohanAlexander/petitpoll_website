Petit Poll's version 0.1 first test delivered the hoped for result. An example poll was randomly generated to a particular overall 2PP value and then most of the data removed. On the basis of that reduced dataset, the model was able to return a similar overall 2PP. The result is a nice sign that something is going well in the model.
