<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p>Petit Poll combines data from biased surveys with statistical methods to generate meaningful results. We are able to gain an understanding of opinion at a more granular level because biased surveys have lower costs and our model shares information as appropriate.</p>

<p>We gather non-representative samples combined with demographic and other data. We then use statistical models to &lsquo;scale up&rsquo; the samples to provide results that are meaningful and akin to representative results. Petit Poll augments, rather than replaces, traditional polls such as Roy Morgan, Newspoll, Galaxy, etc.</p>

<p>Petit Poll&rsquo;s statistical approach is developed in Wang, Rothschild, Goel and Gelman (2014).</p>

<p>In contrast to many other Australian polls we focus on seat counts. In recent federal elections there have been 150 seats. If one party can get 76 seats then the have a majority government (one seat would be lost to appoint the speaker). Nation-wide two-party-preferred estimates are an approximation to this.</p>

<h3 id="team">Team</h3>

<p>Monica and Rohan Alexander are the co-founders of Petit Poll.</p>

<p>Monica is an Assistant Professor in Statistical Sciences and Sociology at the University of Toronto. She received her PhD in Demography at the University of California, Berkeley. Her research interests include statistical demography, mortality and health inequalities, and computational social science.</p>

<p>Rohan Alexander is a PhD student in the Research School of Economics at the ANU. He holds a Bachelor of Economics degree from the University of Queensland and a Master of Economics degree from the ANU. As part of a small team he co-founded GoCampaign which is now part of GO1. He is a consultant at Grosvenor Management Consulting.</p>

<h3 id="logo">Logo</h3>

<p>Our logo is based on Euclid&rsquo;s &lsquo;Elements of Geometry&rsquo;, as coloured by Oliver Byrne in 1847 and republished by Taschen in 2013. The angles of the blue and red inner parallelograms are related to each other. If you understand how they relate then you can use all of that to make claims understand the larger, outer, parallelogram. It&rsquo;s analogous to what we do with Petit Poll &ndash; using information we collect on a small sample and the knowledge of how it should scale up, to understand the bigger picture.</p>
